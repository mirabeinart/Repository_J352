		<p>For avid coffee drinkers, two questions come to mind in the morning:</p>
		<ol>First: Should I drink coffee this morning? <em>(Hint: the answer is usually yes)</em></ol>
		<ol>Second: Where should I get coffee? This is where conflict arises.</ol>
		<p>University of Maryland’s campus is home to many coffee shops, both well-known chains and local cafes. Each location offers different benefits to students and local residents, serving a wide variety of caffeinated (and not) drinks.</p>

			<h5>Starbucks</h5>
			<p>Starbucks has a storefront in College Park Shopping Center, as well as being sold at most cafes on campus, like ESJ’s Food for Thought and McKeldin Library’s Footnotes Cafe. A latte costs, on average, $5. However, Dining Dollars provide discounts to students by bypassing sales tax on purchases. Most cafes on campus accept Dining Dollars.</p>

			<h5>Dunkin'</h5>
			<p>Formerly known as Dunkin' Donuts, this nationwide chain offers coffee drinks at a cheaper price than Starbucks, averaging just under $4. Dunkin' has two locations near UMD’s campus, both located underneath popular off-campus apartment complexes.</p><br>

			<h5>Bagels ‘n Grinds</h5>
			<p>A College Park favorite, Bagels ‘n Grinds is the go-to bagel shop, perfect for early morning breakfasts and lazy weekend brunches. The shop includes a beverage station with “six brews of fresh hot coffee, iced coffee and fresh brewed iced tea,” according to their <a href ="https://www.bagelsngrinds.com/about-us/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p><br>

			<h5>Vigilante Coffee</h5>
			<p>Vigilante’s coffee beans are roasted just down the road at their Hyattsville location. Their lattes are on the more expensive end of the price scale, with prices averaging around $5.50. Rather than a large chain, Vigilante is more of a small town, local coffee shop.</p><br>

	<div class="large-8 medium-6 small-12 cell">
		<p>A survey about coffee preferences and opinions was conducted throughout the spring semester with 89 respondents, all of which are either students or professors at UMD, and showed the following results:</p>
		<p>Of all the coffee shops on/around campus, over 40% of respondents believe that Dunkin' has the fastest turnaround time, from placing an order to receiving a drink. However, under 20% of respondents think that Dunkin' has the best tasting coffee – Dunkin’s greatest benefit is its efficiency and low cost.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, the majority of students think that Starbucks or Vigilante coffees have the best flavor. This begs the question: Are price and quality correlated?</p>

		<p>When asked what coffee shop College Park locals would recommend to visitors, there was a consistent consensus: Vigilante Coffee. </p>
		<p>Among the students who responded to the survey was sophomore biology major Laura DiPalma, who said that Vigilante is her favorite coffee around campus.</p>
		<p>“Every time I get a coffee from Vigilante, it never fails to brighten my day,” DiPalma said. “Some places, like Dunkin', have on and off days, but Vigilante is always good.”</p>

</div><br>
		<p>Another highlight of College Park coffee is Bagels ‘n Grinds’ self-serve coffee bar, which offers a variety of freshly brewed coffees, both hot and cold.</p>

		<p>“I always get the Kona Nut Macadamia coffee,” said sophomore public health major Spencer Sherwood. “My friends always make fun of me for drinking my coffee black, but I love it. The flavors in Bagels ‘n Grinds’ coffee are so unique and yummy.”</p>

		<p>Despite the array of coffee options and shops around campus, the cheapest option for caffeine intake is to make your own coffee at home.</p>
<!-- This is a pullquote that in theory I could include but I don't really like it --
		<aside class="pquote">
    <blockquote>
        <p>1 CUP
        	=
        	26 CENTS
    	</p>
    </blockquote>
		</aside>
	-->

		<p>With ground coffee, one cup costs around 26 cents, according to <a href="https://greenlight.com/learning-center/budgeting/how-much-is-a-cup-of-coffee#" target="_blank"> Greenlight</a>, a platform that teaches budgeting and financial responsibility.</p>

		<p>However, only 54% of survey respondents think that home-brewed coffee is the cheapest option. Buying coffee every day has become a habit for many Americans, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robasghar/2015/05/22/why-we-should-all-be-selling-coffee/?sh=4e672f611113" target="_blank">Forbes</a>. Additionally, many students appreciate the convenience of buying coffee each day, rather than the more economical option.</p>
		<p>In summary:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The University of Maryland offers a plethora of options for students to consume coffee throughout their day, with coffee shops in many locations around and near the edge of campus.</li>
				<li>Each coffee shop offers different options, including price, flavor, and quality.</li>
				<li>Dunkin’ might be the cheapest option in terms of purchasing one coffee each day, but in order to save the most money, you should choose to make coffee at home.</li>
			</ul>
